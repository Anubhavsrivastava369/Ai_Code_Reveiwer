# 🤖 AI Code Reviewer

Tired of endless PR comments and nitpicky reviews?  
This project is an **AI-powered coding buddy** that reviews your code, points out mistakes, and even suggests fixes — just like a teammate who actually reads the docs 🙃.  

---

## ✨ What it does
- 🚩 Catches bugs, bad patterns, and performance issues  
- 🎨 Suggests cleaner, more readable code  
- 🧠 Explains *why* something is wrong (not just that it’s wrong)  
- ⚡ Works across multiple languages  
- 📊 Gives tips on complexity and best practices  

---

## 🛠️ How it’s built
- **Node.js + Express** → backend brain  
- **LLM (Google Generative AI)** → the reviewer that does the thinking  
- **Markdown + syntax highlighting** → so reviews are easy on the eyes
